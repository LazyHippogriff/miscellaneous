Once Git is installed, you need to do a one-time system setup to configure it by declaring
the name and email address you want associated with all your Git commits

Command Line
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "yourname@email.com"
You can always change these configs later if you desire by retyping the same com-
mands with a new name or email address.
